# liri-node-app
The purpose of this app is to show off technical knowledge of nodejs and how to make api calls using keys and secrets along with axios on certain api's.  I have called on Twitter to show my tweets and spotify to search for specific song names.  The screen shots listed below can be found in the images folder to showcase a working product.
